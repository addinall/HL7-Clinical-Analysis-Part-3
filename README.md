HL7 Stuff AND R Programming Assignment 3
======================================================
This repo started out as a repo for a Johns Hopkins Data Scientist course
I took on R programming.  One of the course assignments (in here) was to
interrogate some HL7 CSV data and produce some analysis.

This got me interested in HL7 again, so I am having a muck ouround with
some HL7v3 (and my own HL7v4) that I was sodding around with a few years
ago.

If any of my class mates are interestede, I implemented the R routines
in SQL for comparison.
