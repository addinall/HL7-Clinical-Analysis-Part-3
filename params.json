{"name":"HL7v4","tagline":"","body":"# HL7 DEVELOPMENT \r\n## WAS R Programming Assignment 3\r\n### Mark Addinall\r\n***\r\nThis repo started out as a place for a Johns Hopkins Data Scientist course\r\nI took on R programming.  One of the course assignments (in here) was to\r\ninterrogate some HL7 CSV data and produce some analysis.\r\n\r\nThis got me interested in HL7 again, so I am having a muck around with\r\nsome HL7v3 (and my own HL7v4) that I was sodding around with a few years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n**ehealth.addinall.net**\r\n\r\nI mentioned this a few years ago, and was called mad then, but it seems Marky is ALWAYS right.  What I mentioned some years ago was that HL7 v3, since it was not finished, and had been under development for about 20 years, was never likely to be finished.\r\n\r\nFour years onwards, HL7v3 is still in **_\"BETA development\"_**.  Like everything else developed by a committee it has become big, fat, unwieldy, expensive and self perpetuating.\r\n\r\nI said it then, and it is moreso true now.  **HL7v3** is LONG obsolete before it gets close to being finished.\r\n\r\nThe data store is a tragically complex **XML** implementation, but more than that, the whole architecture is based on the **CORBA/SOAP/XML** model which apart from a few dusty gubbermint departments, has vanished from the face of the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe future of HL7 NEEDS to be **RAPID** development in a **RESTFul** architecture, and switching to **JSON** as a data store.\r\n\r\nAnyone want to prototype **HL7v4 **with me?  This is as good a repo as any to start with.\r\n\r\nMail me and I'll stick you on the magic list.\r\n\r\n## Mark Addinall\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
