<hr><p>This repo started out as a place for a Johns Hopkins Data Scientist course
I took on R programming.  One of the course assignments (in here) was to
interrogate some HL7 CSV data and produce some analysis.</p>

<p>This got me interested in HL7 again, so I am having a muck around with
some HL7v3 (and my own HL7v4) that I was sodding around with a few years
ago.</p>

<p><strong>ehealth.addinall.net</strong></p>

<p>I mentioned this a few years ago, and was called mad then, but it seems Marky is ALWAYS right.  What I mentioned some years ago was that HL7 v3, since it was not finished, and had been under development for about 20 years, was never likely to be finished.</p>

<p>Four years onwards, HL7v3 is still in <strong><em>"BETA development"</em></strong>.  Like everything else developed by a committee it has become big, fat, unwieldy, expensive and self perpetuating.</p>

<p>I said it then, and it is moreso true now.  <strong>HL7v3</strong> is LONG obsolete before it gets close to being finished.</p>

<p>The data store is a tragically complex <strong>XML</strong> implementation, but more than that, the whole architecture is based on the <strong>CORBA/SOAP/XML</strong> model which apart from a few dusty gubbermint departments, has vanished from the face of the Earth.</p>

<p>The future of HL7 NEEDS to be <strong>RAPID</strong> development in a <strong>RESTFul</strong> architecture, and switching to <strong>JSON</strong> as a data store.</p>

<p>Anyone want to prototype **HL7v4 **with me?  This is as good a repo as any to start with.</p>

<p>Mail me and I'll stick you on the magic list.</p>
